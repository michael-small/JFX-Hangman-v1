# JFX-Hangman-v2
This game of hangman built with JavaFX started as a lab in my data structures course. I enjoyed making UI's with Java so much that I made a fork of the lab and modified it to be about my favorite streamer, [Jerma985](https://www.reddit.com/r/jerma985/).

I haven't messed around with the project in awhile, but I intend in my freetime to eventually polish it up and release it for the Jerma subreddit.
